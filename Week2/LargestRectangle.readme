Largest Rectangle in Histogram
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem Description
--------------------------
Given heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed using consecutive bars.

Solution Overview
-------------------------
Uses stack-based approach to efficiently find the largest rectangle by maintaining indices of bars in increasing order of height.

Data Structure Used
-------------------------
Stack: Stores indices of histogram bars in increasing order of height
Array/List: Input histogram heights

Why This Data Structure is Efficient
-----------------------------------------
Stack Properties: LIFO nature helps in finding boundaries efficiently
Index Storage: Storing indices instead of values helps calculate width
Monotonic Stack: Maintains increasing order for optimal boundary detection
Single Pass: Processes each bar exactly once

Algorithm Approach
-------------------------
Iterate through all bars including a virtual bar of height 0 at the end
For each bar, maintain stack in increasing order of heights
When current bar is shorter, pop from stack and calculate area
Width is calculated using stack properties (current index - previous index - 1)
Keep track of maximum area encountered

Time Complexity
-----------------------
Time Complexity: O(n) - Each bar is pushed and popped at most once
Space Complexity: O(n) - Stack can store up to n indices in worst case
